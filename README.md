# DATRAS

_A repository for code and examples related to the ICES DATRAS database_

### DATRAS is an online database of trawl surveys with access to standard data products

DATRAS (the Database of Trawl Surveys) has been developed to collate and document the survey data, assure data quality, standardise data formats and calculations, and ease data handling and availability. With the possibility for instant remote access, the data from DATRAS are used for stock assessments and fish community studies by the ICES community and public users.

DATRAS stores data collected primarily from bottom trawl fish surveys coordinated by ICES expert groups. The survey data are covering the Baltic Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat, North Sea, English Channel, Celtic Sea, Irish Sea, Bay of Biscay and the eastern Atlantic from the Shetlands to Gibraltar. At present, there are more than 45 years of continuous time series data in DATRAS, and survey data are continuously updated by national institutions.

DATRAS has an integrated quality check utility. All data, before entering the database, have to pass an extensive quality check.

Data products (such as CPUE per area or indices) and raw data, can be freely downloaded according to the ICES Data policy.
